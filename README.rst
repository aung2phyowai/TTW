Trainable Time Warping (TTW)
===========================

Python implementation of TTW, a time warping algorithm that estimates the DTW averaging solution in linear time and space complexity using a new deformable convolutional kernel, shifted sinc kernel.

This repository contains the MATLAB code of three dynamic time warping (DTW) averaging algorithms: GTW, TTW and FLTW. All these algorithms have linear time and space complexity with respect to the length and the number of input time-series. Details of these algorithms have been explained in:
